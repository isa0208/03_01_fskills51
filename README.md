In recent years, Muay Thai, the ancient martial art of Thailand, has garnered global acclaim for its effectiveness and cultural richness. Enthusiasts from around the world are eager to immerse themselves in authentic training experiences. However, navigating the myriad training options available in Thailand can be a daunting task. From budget-friendly gyms to high-end training camps, the cost and package details vary significantly, leaving many potential practitioners overwhelmed. 

This project aims to address this issue by developing a simple website, Sabai Muay Thai, with a pricing calculator for Muay Thai training packages in Thailand.

The pricing calculator is designed to simplify the decision-making process for enthusiasts., including novice Muay Thai practitioners, seasoned fighters seeking advanced training, and casual enthusiasts interested in training in Thailand.
